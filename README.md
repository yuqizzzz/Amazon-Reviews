# Amazon fine food Reviews

**Data source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews


**Project Summary:** Online reviews have some influence on consumer decision-making. The purpose of this project is not focus on the Score, but only focus on the positive and negative sentiment of the review. To do so, we will build a sentiment analysis prediction model to help us predict whether reviews are positive or negative for a product. When the data is ready, we will load it into predicitve algorithms. In the end, we hope to find a "best" model for predicting the recommendation's sentiment.
